# Lana-Interledger-2025
**Lana** is an open payment solution that connects tourists and Mexican merchants,  even those outside the banking system, using **Interledger (ILP)** and **Open Payments**. In Mexico, *“lana”* means money. Like wool, it helps funds flow naturally, safely, and without borders, empowering inclusive tourism and local economies.
