### 🐏 **Lana — Borderless Payments, Mexican Soul**

**Description:**

**Lana** is an open payment solution that connects tourists and local merchants in Mexico — even those outside the formal banking system — using the **Interledger Protocol (ILP)** and **Open Payments APIs**.
In Mexico, *“lana”* means *money*. And just like wool from a sheep, Lana helps money **flow naturally**, **safely**, and **without borders**.

> 🌎 **Tourists** can pay local artisans, guides, and small businesses instantly — using any wallet or currency.
> 
> 💰 **Merchants** (formal or informal) can receive digital payments directly in pesos (MXN), with no need for a bank account or POS terminal.
> 
> 🧩 **Built on Interledger**, Lana enables interoperability between wallets like BBVA, PayPal, MercadoPago, and community wallets through open standards.

**Mission:** Empower Mexico’s tourism economy through open, inclusive, and interoperable payments.
